Cookiecutter templates enables developers and data scientists to create projects from a predefined template. This template is a modern Python package project structure that utilizes a number of tools to automate and align with best practices in order to have smoother development. The project template can be viewed from the [structure](structure.md) document. The template creates a project that can be hosted on GitHub and deployed to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

</div>

This template uses `husky`, `commitlint` and `pre-commit` managed by `pnpm` to use `git` hooks to automate tasks such as linting, formatting, testing, etc. before a commit is made. This ensures that the code is always in a consistent state and that the commit history is clean and easy to read. The commit messages are also linted to ensure that they follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

</div>

`mkdocs` is used to generate a static site for documentation of the project from the `docs` folder. This is hosted on GitHub Pages through a GitHub Action in `.github`. The site is automatically built and deployed on every push to the `main` branch. [Mkdocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) is used as the theme for the documentation site.

</div>

This project is primarily built for `.vscode` but can be used with other editors as well. The `.vscode` folder contains a number of settings and extensions that are recommended for the project. These are automatically installed when the project is opened in VS Code.
